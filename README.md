# 📡 Convolutional Coding – CT216 Project

## 🔍 What is Convolutional Coding?

Convolutional coding is an error correction technique that adds redundancy to a message in a way that allows errors to be detected and corrected at the receiver. Unlike block coding, it operates on a stream of data rather than on discrete blocks. This makes it highly suitable for real-time applications such as voice, video, and data over noisy channels like wireless or satellite communication.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Input bits are passed through a **shift register**.
- Output bits are generated by applying **XOR (mod-2 addition)** to selected bits in the shift register.
- Defined by parameters:
  - `k`: Number of input bits
  - `n`: Number of output bits
  - `K`: Constraint length (memory depth)
- The **code rate** is `R = k/n`.
